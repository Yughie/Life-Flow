##💓 Life-Flow – Organ Donation Database Management System
📘 About the Project
Life-Flow is a web-based organ donation database management system developed as part of our second-year coursework in Computer Science. It simulates a real-world solution for managing donor and recipient records, organ availability, and match tracking through a responsive and interactive interface.

The project aims to raise awareness of how technology can support life-saving medical systems and promote ethical, organized data handling in the context of organ donation.

🤝 Why We Built This
This system was not only an academic requirement — it was also an attempt to explore how software can be used for social good. Organ donation saves lives, and having a streamlined, secure, and organized system for managing this process is essential.

Life-Flow is our small contribution to that conversation.
