      <h1>Who can Donate</h1>
      <p>All people should consider themselves potential organ, eye, and tissue donors.
        Your age, race, ethnicity, religion, or health (in most cases) donâ€™t matter.</p>

      <h1 style="color:rgb(158, 3, 3);">Is There an Age Limit for Organ Donation</h1>
      <h1 style="font-size: medium;">There's no age limit to donation or to signing up. People in their 50s, 60s, 70s, and older 
        have donated and received organs.</h1>  
        
        <h1 style="color:rgb(158, 3, 3);">Organ Donation and Children</h1> 
        <h1 style="font-size: medium;">Organ donation by children is a difficult subject. The loss of a child or infant is tragic. 
            The option to donate organs, eyes, and tissues is especially hard on parents, as they make 
            the decisions. These are the facts about teen, child, and infant donation.</h1>
            
            <h1 style="color:rgb(158, 3, 3);">Religion and Organ Donation</h1>
            <h1 style="font-size: medium;">Many religions in the United States (U.S.) support organ donation.
                The decision to become a donor is personal. If you have questions about your religion and 
                organ donation, ask your faith leader.
